Discuss how I managed the state in my project

I have created four states in this project .In the first state ,using fetch on the fake data ,I am keeping it in the courses variable .The second state used to selected courses should not be duplicated . The third state is used to keep total credit hours . The fourth state is used to keep remaining credit hours .
